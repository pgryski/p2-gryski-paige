		<h3>Providing safety, shelter, and dignity to farm animals in need and educating our community through experience.</h3>
		<div class="homep">
		<p class="hometext">We provide a home and safe shelter for unwanted farm animals. It is a compassionate environment where the animals are respected and can live a life free of fear. We adopt animals that have been surrendered by their owners or animals that have been abandoned and are found by concerned individuals or by other animal rescue organizations. We also provide educational tours of the sanctuary so people can interact with the animals. We believe a large part of changing people’s attitudes towards farm animals lies in education through interaction. Very few people have had the opportunity to connect with the animals they find on their dinner plates.</p>
		<div class="verticalline"></div>
		<p class="hometext">The animals that have come to live here and the animals we have rehomed are living vibrant healthy lives. They are secure and unafraid. This is great for the animal, great for the person who was unable to keep their pet and through farm tours these animals teach people to respect livestock as you would any other living creature.
		We offer sanctuary to chickens, ducks, geese, pigs, goats, cattle and other livestock. Although we would love to take in all the creatures that need our space is limited. If you have questions about raising livestock, building animal enclosures or even what kind of animal will fit your lifestyle please contact us via email info@floridarescuefarm.org or call (941)209-9558 we’re happy to help.</p>

		<aside><p>"My wife researched about this place via Facebook for a while and today we had the opportunity to visit, it was an amazing experience and I would recommend it to everyone looking to interact with so many different loving animals with such unique stories. Some of these animals have survived incredibly hard situations and it is awesome to see them so happy and united walking around the property. It was totally hearrt warming and nothing short of amazing! My son is 10 years old and has never interacted with goats, chickens and cows and he loves meeting them and getting to be around them. As far as the owner of the place, he is an amazing person who treated us with the utmost respect and kindness. He had a young lady who is a volunteer helping give us the tour, she was amazing too and very passionate about animals being loved, respected, and free."</p><p id="name">-Engel Vilorio</p></aside>
