		<p id="visitorintro">We love to have people visit the farm and we give private tours on Saturdays and Sundays. Tours start at 10:00 and usually take 1-2 hours. We do require that visitors wear masks and practice social distancing. We are not like a traditional petting zoo type experience. Most of our animals free-range during the day so you may be approached by a cow or goat looking for a scratch behind the ears! Much of the experience is observing and interacting with the animals in their natural environment.</p>

		<h3>Volunteer lunch and event food policy</h3>
		<p>The primary purpose of Florida Rescue Farm, Inc. is to provide safety, shelter, and dignity for farm animals in need. This guiding principle, that all animals should be free from exploitation and suffering, extends to all aspects of our non-profit. Therefore it is our policy that only vegan food will be offered at Florida Rescue Farm, Inc. and at any event Florida Rescue Farm, Inc sponsors.</p>
		<p>Although this seems obvious we felt it was important to have as a policy for the farm. We were inspired to do this by Animal Placeâ€™s Food for Thought Program which helps nonprofits adopt mission-driven menu policies for fundraising and sponsored events. Please take a moment to check out their website and please pass it on to any of your favorite non-profits.</p>
